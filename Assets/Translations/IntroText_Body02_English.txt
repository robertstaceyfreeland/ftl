You are the lone survivor of this Galatic Destroyer.  The other 18 crew members have mysteriously dissapeared and now its up to you to get home.

The good news: After much configuration of the ship, you have managed to set all of your systems on Automatic.

The Bad News:  With the limited fuel onboard You will have to make several jumps through unkown systems to get back home.

There are two starbases located along your path where you can make repairs if needed and perhaps scrounge for more fuel.

Good Luck!
